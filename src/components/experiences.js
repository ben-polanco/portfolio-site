        "content":"<h5>Led product innovation team at a leading Pharma Co. focused on increasing consumption of proprietary therapies (insulin & GLP-1s) using personalized medicine as a pull-through mechanism. Worked with medical affairs, regulatory, legal, and the digital transformation CoE to identify viable populations, gauge patient sentiment, and define the north star vision.<br /><br />The product strategy initiative resulted in partnership with a startup pursuing early trials of a novel microfluidics device for early detection of poor kidney function.</h5><br /><p># BACKGROUND:<br />  Diabetes has negative effects on kidney health.  Kidney dialysis is the most expensive complication of diabetes, but chronic kidney disease (CKD) is difficult to diagnose. Kidney damage often goes unchecked until major complications arise.<br /><br />Metformin, the leading 1st line therapy for diabetes, also has negative side effects on kidney function. <b>We hypothesized that increasing early diagnoses or genetic testing for CKD risk would prompt HCPs to move patients from Metformin to less damaging therapies (like my client's insulin or GLP-1s).</b> My client holds a strong market share of existing Metformin alternatives, so we expect a large portion of the increased sales to be captured directly, with knock-on effects for pricing power due to improved long-term outcomes.</p>"
