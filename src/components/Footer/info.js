      <p>
I spent the last <span>seven years at Accenture leading strategy, design, and product management</span> for high tech and pharma companies. I specialize in guiding teams through the murky, early stages of new product development - using agile sprints and rapid experimentation to pursue market fit.  Iâ€™m a <span>hands-on, purpose-driven leader</span> who leans in to build a culture of shared responsibility and trust with everyone I work with.
<br /><br />
My product experience centers on <span>B2B and B2C software apps (web, iOS, Android)</span> that use connected devices and advanced analytics. I enjoy facing intractable problems to find grounded, human solutions that work in the real world.  I'm passionate about <span>improving health, reducing societal costs, and building stronger, more vibrant communities.</span>
<br /><br />
If you're interested in knowing more about me or my work, please feel free to reach out. I'm always open to new opportunities and challenges.
