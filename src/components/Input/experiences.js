These insights helped form the basis of our solution hypothesis: <b>at-home testing for kidney risk would expand early diagnoses of CKD, resulting in increased conversion from Metformin to insulin or GLP-1s.</b><br />My client holds a strong market share of existing Metformin alternatives, so we assume a large portion of the increased sales to be captured directly with knock-on effects for pricing power due to improved long-term outcomes.</p>"
