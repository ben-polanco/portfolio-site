End-stage kidney failure is among the most expensive complications of diabetes, but chronic kidney disease (CKD) is difficult to diagnose. Kidney damage often goes unchecked until major complications arise.<br /><br />Metformin, the leading 1st line therapy for diabetes, also has negative side effects on kidney function. Together with medical affairs, legal/regulatory, and the digital transformation CoE, we researched market dynamics, technology trends, and patient/provider challenges to inform our solution hypothesis--that at-home testing for CKD risk would expand early diagnoses and result in increased conversion from Metformin to insulin or GLP-1s.<br /><br />My client holds a strong market share of existing Metformin alternatives, so we expect a large portion of the increased sales to be captured directly with knock-on effects for pricing power due to improved long-term outcomes.</p>"
