# User Feedback
- the site doesn't really **introduce who you are up front**, so the user is thrown into the deep end too quickly. Take a step back and draw the contours of who you are before launching into the case studies
- The **text looks pixelated**
- The **images look a little blurry**
- you have to scroll around a lot to see the popup text - the **pop-up text should be angled** in the same direction as the building
